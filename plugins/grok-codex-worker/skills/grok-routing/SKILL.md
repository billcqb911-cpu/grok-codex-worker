# When to call Grok

## Prefer Grok MCP tools

- Substantial debugging after Codex is stuck
- Second-opinion implementation of a non-trivial change
- Best-of-N alternative approaches (`bestOfN`)
- Risky edits that should land in a worktree (`worktree`)
- **Ambiguous architecture** → `grok_plan` then implement, or `grok_design`
- **Multi-PR delivery from a design doc** → `grok_execute_plan`
- **Named multi-agent recipes** → `grok_workflow`
- **PR CI/review babysitting** → `grok_babysit`
- Image/video generation (`grok_image`, `grok_video`)
- Documents (`grok_document` with `type` pdf|docx|pptx)
- Structured or adversarial code review before shipping
- Long-running investigation better as a background job

## Prefer staying in Codex

- Quick questions, renames, one-line fixes
- Tiny edits with obvious answers
- Pure conversation without repo mutation

## Host capability boundary

- Codex remains the only principal that may call other Codex plugins/MCP tools,
  browsers, connectors, credentials, logins, uploads, or external submissions.
- If a task requires one of those capabilities, keep that step in Codex and pass
  only the minimum sanitized result to Grok. Set `hostToolRequired=true` on the
  Grok handoff when the worker must refuse delegation.
- Grok is a bounded project worker, not a recursive Codex agent. Its process does
  not receive the Codex MCP registry or user approval handles.

## Intent → tool

| User intent | Prefer |
| --- | --- |
| Stuck on a bug / implement a fix | `grok_rescue` (+ worktree + check) |
| Unclear approach before coding | `grok_plan` |
| Architecture / design doc + PR plan | `grok_design` |
| Ship a design doc’s PR DAG | `grok_execute_plan` (or `latest=true` after design) |
| Multi-dimension structured fan-out | `grok_workflow` |
| Ship quality on a branch/PR | `grok_review` (+ `postPending` for GH) |
| Challenge design assumptions | `grok_adversarial_review` |
| Watch / fix open PRs | `grok_babysit` |
| Deck / PDF / Word | `grok_document` |
| Brand stills / clips | `grok_image` / `grok_video` |
| Find past Grok work | `grok_sessions` |

## Depth pipeline (multi-PR / ambiguous product work)

Prefer this sequence over a single giant rescue:

1. **`grok_plan`** — explore + plan.md when the approach is unclear (artifacts under `.grok-plans/`).
2. **`grok_design`** — consensus design doc + PR Plan → artifacts under `.grok-designs/`.
3. **`grok_execute_plan`** with `latest=true` (or explicit `designDoc`) — implement the PR DAG in worktrees.
4. **`grok_review`** / **`grok_babysit`** — quality and CI/review loop.

Use **`grok_workflow`** when you have a named multi-agent recipe (fan-out review dimensions, etc.), not ad-hoc parallel rescues.

## Bounded execution profiles

- Codebase map / investigation without edits: `readOnly=true`; the worker forces
  the strict sandbox and denies Edit, Write, Bash, MCP, and web tools.
- Planning only: `grok_plan` or `planMode=true` on rescue.
- Custom agents, cross-session memory, subagents, caller allow rules, and
  always-approve modes are outside the worker boundary and are rejected.
- Grok cannot run a shell test command. Put the command in `checkCommand`; the
  Codex-side companion runs it after Grok returns and verifies the result.

## Parallel jobs

When workstreams are independent, **run multiple Grok jobs at once**:

| Need | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| Fix / investigate | `grok_rescue` |
| Plan | `grok_plan` |
| Design | `grok_design` |
| Execute plan | `grok_execute_plan` |
| Workflow | `grok_workflow` |
| Review | `grok_review` |
| Babysit | `grok_babysit` |
| Document | `grok_document` |
| Image / video | `grok_image` / `grok_video` |

How:

1. Split into independent prompts.
2. Start each MCP tool with `background=true` when it may take time.
3. Track each job id via `grok_status`.
4. Collect results with `grok_result`.

Do **not** serialize independent Grok work just because another job is running.
